RETROSPECTIVE (Team 2)
=====================================

## PROCESS MEASURES 

### Macro statistics

- Number of stories committed vs. done: (5,4)
- Total points committed vs. done: (32, 28)
- Nr of hours planned vs. spent (as a team): (42, 46:30)

**Remember** that a story is done ONLY if it fits the Definition of Done:
 
- Unit Tests passing
- Code review completed
- Code present on VCS
- End-to-End tests performed


### Detailed statistics

| Story  | # Tasks | Hours est. | Hours actual |
|--------|---------|------------|--------------|
| _#0_Get_a_ticket   |  5       |        10      |        10      |
| _#1_Call_the_next_client       |  3       |  4     |          6            |
_#2_Minimum_waiting_time       |    3    |    4        |       6       |
_#0_Manager_statistics       |  3           |        10    |        10      |
   
- Hours per task average, standard deviation (estimate and actual): (32/14=2.26) - (28/14=2)
- Total task estimation error ratio: sum of total hours estimation / sum of total hours spent - 1: ( 1 - (28/32) = 0.125)

  
## QUALITY MEASURES 

- Unit Testing:
  - Total hours estimated => 4
  - Total hours spent => 4
  - Nr of automated unit test cases => 7
- E2E testing:
  - Total hours estimated => 4
  - Total hours spent => 4
- Code review 
  - Total hours estimated => 2
  - Total hours spent => 2
  


## ASSESSMENT

- What caused your errors in estimation (if any)?
  - Underestimation of the tasks
  - Not calculating learning rate of a new framework
  - Bad division of task works


- What lessons did you learn (both positive and negative) in this sprint?
  - Don't complicate the UI
  - Estimate better hours
  - Simple taskes can take longer times some times
  - We need to take in account the learning process

- Improvement goals for the next sprint and how to achieve them (technical tasks, team coordination, etc.)
  - Better communication in the team
  - Better distribution of the work
  - Better planning


- One thing you are proud of as a Team!!
  - All tasks except one have been completed
